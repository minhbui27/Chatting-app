# A Chatting app built during winter 2020 for CodersSB winter series
### Duration: About 8 weeks
Frontend
- Built with ReactJS along with ES6 JS.
- Used tailwindcss for customizations.
- The large amount of CSS in the code was due to an import of a sass file that included a lot of the styles that were used for the website.

Backend
- Used google Firebase api to save messages along with reminders.
- Security a large concern so we only used the built in configuration of the Firebase api to implement security.

The current state of the project
- Currently, it is a complete and working project, where you could save your own reminders and chat cross platform with whoever has access to the website.
- There are some bloat in the repo, but it doesn't affect performance, to be fixed in the future.
